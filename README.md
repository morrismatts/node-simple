A simple site skeleton using Node.js, Express.js, Jade for templating, and Sass for CSS
=====

Not much to see here, this is very similar to hundreds of other site skeletons I'm sure.

To run (this assumes you have Node and NPM installed):

1. Clone this repo.
1. Navigate to the repo in terminal.
1. Run "npm install"
1. Run "node server.js"
1. In your browser go to "0.0.0.0:8088", you should see "Hi there!"
